# Blooket-UI-Test
Blooket UI (PRIVATE)

How to Install:
You will need to create a bookmarklet, please check the linked website below (Note that it may be different for different browsers, however the website has tutorials for all mainstream browsers.)

I will try to add more gamemodes, currently I have a fishing frenzy code that can be used without creating a bookmarklet.

This project is not finished and WILL have new additions so stay tuned.
